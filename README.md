**Duration:** AUGUST to SEPTEMBER 2024

**Design Name** : SEQUENCE DETECTOR 1010 USING MEALY MACHINE(NON OVERLAPPING) BY USING SINGLE PROCEDURAL BLOCK

**Module Name** : mealy_1010_seq_det_non_over

**Mentor:** NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**Project** : FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN

**Objective:**

Design and implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) that can model and control a specific system or process, such as:

A vending machine
A traffic light controller
A digital clock
A robotic arm
Key Activities:

Requirements gathering: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.

System analysis: Study the system or process to be modeled by the FSM.

State identification: Identify and define the states of the system or process.

Transition definition: Define the transitions between states.

State transition diagram/table creation: Create a visual representation of the FSM.

FSM implementation: Write code or design hardware to implement the FSM.

Simulation/testing: Verify and validate the FSM through simulation or testing.

Debugging: Identify and fix errors or issues in the FSM.

Optimization: Refine the FSM for efficiency, scalability, and reliability.

Documentation: Write a report detailing the FSM design and implementation.

Testing and validation: Develop test cases and report results.

Review and revision: Review the FSM design and implementation, and make revisions as needed.
